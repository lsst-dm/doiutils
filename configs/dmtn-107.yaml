  This document reviews five options for alert production in LSST Operations
  Year 1 (LOY1), taking into account any implications on LSST formal
  requirements including up-scopes, down-scopes or explicit violations. The Data
  Management System Science Team's preferred option for maximizing LSST science
  is to generate template images from as much of the data from the commissioning
  and/or science verification phases as possible and use them to run Difference
  Image Analysis and alert production during LOY1. A proposal to increase the
  sky area covered during commissioning via a "filler" scheduler program is also
  presented. As a potential moderate up-scope, this study presents an option to
  build interim templates on a $\sim$monthly basis during LOY1, which could
  increase the accessible sky area by ~1000-2000 deg**2 per month, and should be
  reconsidered closer to the start of Operations.
