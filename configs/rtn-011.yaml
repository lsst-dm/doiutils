abstract: |-
  This document outlines Rubin Observatory's plans for a dedicated \emph{Early
  Science Program} to enable high-impact science prior to the first annual data
  release of the  Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Components of the
  Early Science Program include releasing science-grade commissioning data
  products via a series of ``Data Previews,'' ramping up of the transient alert
  stream during commissioning,  implementing a program of incremental template
  generation to augment alert production in the early phases of the survey, and
  the first LSST Data Release, DR1, based on the first 6 months of data from the
  LSST. A detailed breakdown of which data products can be expected when is
  provided. The Rubin Operations team is working closely with the science
  community to optimize the Early Science Program for the time-domain and solar
  system science achievable in the first year of operations. This is a living
  document; both it and the Early Science Program will continue to evolve over
  the course of commissioning and pre-operations in response to the state of the
  as-built system and to community guidance.
