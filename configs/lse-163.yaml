  This document describes the data products and processing services to be
  delivered by the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory whilst performing the
  Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). LSST will deliver three levels of data
  products and services. Prompt data products are computed and released within
  24 hours of observation, and include images, difference images, catalogs of
  sources and objects detected in difference images, and catalogs of Solar
  System objects. Their primary purpose is to enable rapid follow-up of time-
  domain events. Data Release data products are computed during annual
  processing campaigns, and include well-calibrated single-epoch images, deep
  coadds, and catalogs of objects, sources, and forced sources, enabling static
  sky and precision time-domain science.  The Science Platform will allow for
  the creation of User Generated data products and will enable science cases
  that greatly benefit from co-location of user processing and/or data within
  the Rubin Observatory Data Access Center.  LSST will also devote 10% of
  observing time to programs with special cadence. Their data products will be
  created using the same software and hardware as Prompt and Data Release
  products. All data products will be made available using user-friendly
  databases and web services.
