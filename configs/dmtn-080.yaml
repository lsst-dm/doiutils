abstract: |-
  LSST images will be contaminated with transient artifacts, such as optical
  ghosts, satellite trails, and cosmic rays, and with transient astronomical
  sources, such as asteroid ephemerides.  We developed and tested an algorithm
  to find and reject these artifacts during coaddition, in order to produce
  clean coadds to be used for deep detection and preliminary object
  characterization. This algorithm, CompareWarpAssembleCoadd, uses the time-
  series of PSF-matched warped images to identify transient artifacts. It
  detects artifact candidates on the image differences between each PSF-matched
  warp and a static sky model.  These artifact candidates include both true
  transient artifacts and difference-image false positives such as difficult-
  subtract-sources and variable sources such as stars and quasars. We use the
  feature that true transients appear at a given position in the difference
  images in only a small fraction (configurable) of visits, whereas variable
  sources and difficult-to-subtract sources appear in most difference images. In
  this report, we present a description of the method and an evaluation using
  Hyper SuprimeCam PDR1 data.
