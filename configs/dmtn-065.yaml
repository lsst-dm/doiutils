abstract: |-
  Special Programs are additional survey areas and/or observing strategies that
  are driven by specific science goals which build on, or are beyond, the core
  science pillars of the Wide Fast Deep Main Survey. In order to meet the
  requirements and enable science related to Special Programs, this document
  provides recommendations for Rubin Data Management regarding processing and
  serving data products for Special Programs. Hardware and processing boundaries
  on the potential diversity of data from Special Programs are discussed along
  with scenarios in which user-generated processing and data products might be
  needed to meet Special Programs' science goals.
