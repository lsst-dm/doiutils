  We describe the proposed design and implementation of the LSST Alert
  Distribution System, which provides rapid dissemination of alerts to community
  alert brokers. At time of writing, this service is still under development;
  this “living document” describes current thinking, but is expected to evolve
  over the course of LSST construction.
