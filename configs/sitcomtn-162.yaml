  The purpose of this technote is to test the technical quality of LSSTComCam
  commissioning data, specifically the Rubin_SV_38_7 field, by utilizing
  cell-based coadds and Metadetection by measuring the tangential and cross
  weak lensing shear profiles of the massive cluster Abell 360 (called A360
  throughout the technote). The process entails generating the cell-based
  coadds for Metadetection to run on, identifying and removing cluster member
  galaxies, applying quality cuts, calibrating the shear measurements, and
  validation.

  Cell-based coadds and Metadetection are both currently in the process of
  being implemented within the LSST Science Pipelines at the time of this
  technote. There is substantial technical value in attempting a difficult
  measurement prior to full implementation. Measuring the tangential shear
  around A360 will showcase the current abilities of these algorithms, as
  well as highlight where work is still needed. As seen from the resulting
  shear profile of A360, the cell-based coadds and Metadetection are able to
  work in tandem to produce a shear catalog and resulting reduced shear profile.

  This technote is one part of a series studying A360 in order to both stress
  test the commissioning camera  and demonstrate the technical capabilities
  of the Vera Rubin Observatory. We study the quality of the PSF modeling and
  impact it can have on cluster WL in [Combet et al., 2025], implementation
  of cell-based coadds and subsequent use for Metadetect [Sheldon et al., 2023]
  in this technote, photometric calibration in (in prep), source selection
  and photometric redshifts in [Adari et al., 2025], use of Anacal [Li et al.,
  2024] to produce a cluster shear profile in [Li et al., 2025], and
  background subtraction in this field and Fornax in [Zhou et al., 2025].
