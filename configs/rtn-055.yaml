title: Study of the Linearity of the CCDs of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory
handle: RTN-055

abstract: |-
  We show our exploration of sets of PTC data for different detectors of the
  LSSTCam, and inspect how it deviates from polynomial and exponential fits.
  We present a tutorial on how to connect to the Rubin Science Platform and
  access the notebooks and other project files. Then we present the approach
  taken to work with the LSST Science Pipeline's linearizer algorithm and the
  results obtained by varying the parameters involved in the different fits
  that can be used.
