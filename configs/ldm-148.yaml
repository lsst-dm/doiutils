  The Rubin Observatory LSST Data Management System (DMS) is a set of services
  employing a variety of software components running on computational and
  networking infrastructure that combine to deliver science data products to the
  observatory's users and support observatory operations.  This document
  describes the components, their service instances, and their deployment
  environments as well as the interfaces among them, the rest of the LSST
  system, and the outside world.
