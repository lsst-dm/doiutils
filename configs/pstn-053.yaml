abstract: |-
  This document is authored by the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee (SCOC),
  guided by the community input, and it will serve as a roadmap for the
  concluding round of survey cadence simulations. These simulations, to be
  delivered during early calendar year 2022, will inform the phase 2 survey
  strategy recommendation which will define the baseline strategy for starting
  the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The phase 2
  SCOC recommendation will be delivered to the Rubin Observatory Operations
  Director before the end of calendar year 2022.
