abstract: |-
  LATISS, the LSST Atmospheric Transmission Imager and Slitless Spectrograph,
  is installed on the Rubin Auxiliary Telescope, a 1.2-meter telescope
  dedicated to atmospheric characterization at the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin
  Observatory site. It uses a 4k x 4k CCD, made by ITL, of the same type as
  used on LSSTCam. It is designed to measure atmospheric transmission and
  calibrate LSST observations by taking spectra of standard stars.
