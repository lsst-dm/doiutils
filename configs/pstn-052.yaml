abstract: |-
  We cover the basics of how a rolling cadence survey strategy can work, and
  review the results of a variety of rolling simulations. We find that Type Ia
  SNe recovery can be enhanced by using rolling cadence, while detecting fast
  microlensing events are dominated by footprint coverage.
