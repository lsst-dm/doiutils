abstract: |-
  From 24 October to 11 December 2024, the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory
  conducted an on-sky campaign using the engineering LSST Commissioning Camera
  (LSSTComCam) to test the end-to-end functionality of hardware and software, as
  well as operational procedures. This interim report provides a preliminary
  technical overview of our understanding of the integrated system performance
  based tests and analyses conducted during the LSSTComCam on-sky campaign. The
  objectives are to synthesize what we have learned about the system in a timely
  way to inform on-going commissioning efforts, and to inform the Rubin science
  community on the progress of the LSSTComCam on-sky campaign. The report is
  organized into sections to describe major activities during the campaign, as
  well as multiple aspects of the demonstrated system and science performance.
  All of the results presented here are to be understood as work in progress
  using engineering data and the initial versions of the data processing
  pipelines; the report is a living document that will be updated as analyses
  are refined.
