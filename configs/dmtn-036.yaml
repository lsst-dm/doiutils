  The jointcal package simultaneously optimizes the astrometric and photometric
  calibrations of a set of astronomical images. In principle and often in
  practice, this approach produces distortion and thoroughput models which are
  more precise than when fitted independently. This is especially true when the
  images are deeper than the astrometric reference catalogs. In the "Astromatic"
  software suite, this simultaneous astrometry functionality is fulfilled by
  "SCAMP". The code we describe here has similar aims, but follows a slightly
  different route. Jointcal is built on top of the the LSST Data Management
  software stack.
