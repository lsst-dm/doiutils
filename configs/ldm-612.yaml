abstract: |-
  A major product of the nightly processing of LSST images is a world-public
  stream of alerts from transient, variable, and moving sources. Science users
  will access these alerts through community brokers or through a simple
  filtering service provided by LSST. This document provides a guide to the
  plans and policies for the alert distribution system to aid science users,
  broker developers, funding agencies, and LSST Project personnel. It describes
  the components of the alert distribution system and the data rights required
  to access specific scientific products. It provides guidelines for
  organizations developing community brokers and describes the planned
  capabilities of the LSST simple alert filtering service and Science Platform
  to aid science users in planning for LSST science.
