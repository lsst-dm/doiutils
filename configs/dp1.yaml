abstract: |-
  The Legacy Survey of Space and Time Data Preview 1 (DP1) is the first release
  of data from the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. It consists of raw and
  calibrated single-epoch images, co-adds, difference images, detection
  catalogs, and other derived data products. DP1 is based on 1792 science-grade
  optical/near-infrared exposures acquired over 48 distinct nights by the Rubin
  Commissioning Camera, LSSTComCam, on the Simonyi Survey Telescope at the
  Summit Facility on Cerro Pach√≥n, Chile during the first on-sky commissioning
  campaign in late 2024. DP1 covers a total of approximately 15 sq. deg. over
  seven roughly equally-sized non-contiguous fields, each independently observed
  in six broad photometric bands, ugrizy, spanning a range of stellar densities
  and latitudes and overlapping with external reference datasets.
