  This document describes the recommendations formulated by the Survey Cadence
  Optimization Committee (SCOC) of Vera C. Rubin Observatory for the observing
  strategy of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). These "Phase 2"
  recommendations follow the initial "Phase 1" recommendations released in
  December 2021 as PSTN-053, and convey the current recommendations for the
  initial implementation of the LSST. These recommendations are based on the
  SCOC analysis of LSST simulations generated according to PSTN-053 and the
  feedback received from the scientific community on those simulations. These
  recommendations should be considered as the current guidance for implementing
  the LSST observing survey at the start of the survey, a strategy to be
  reviewed regularly over the survey lifetime, and are accompanied by a
  simulation, baseline_v3.0, which represents a specific implementation of these
  recommendations. While these recommendations dramatically narrow the possible
  LSST observing parameter choices, we emphasize that at this stage they do not
  yet represent a final or complete set of recommendations for the survey
  strategy, and several details are still to be refined. Furthermore, the
  strategy should be considered "living" and subject to evolution throughout the
  survey. The SCOC continues to engage with the community to finalize its
  recommendations. At the time of the release of this document, the final phases
  of construction of Rubin Observatory are ongoing with an expected first light
  in mid-2024. We expect the SCOC recommendations to be revised as needed, as
  knowledge of the system as built and the outcome of commissioning and Science
  Verification mature. This document describes the Phase 2 SCOC recommendations
  —highlighting elements that can be considered final and elements that remain
  to be finalized—, the process through which the SCOC has converged on these
  recommendations, and the working plan for the SCOC starting in January 2023
  through the start of the survey to finalize the initial implementation of the
  Legacy Survey of Space and Time.
