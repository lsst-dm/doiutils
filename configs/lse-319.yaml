  This document defines and describes the "LSST Science Platform," a set of
  integrated web applications and services deployed at the LSST Data Access
  Centers (DACs) through which the scientific community will access, visualize,
  subset, and perform next-to-the-data analysis of the data collected by the
  Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).  These services can be broken down to
  three different "Aspects": a web Portal, designed to provide essential data
  access and visualization services through a simple-to-use website, a Notebook
  environment, that will provide a Jupyter Notebook-like interface, based on
  JupyterLab, enabling next-to-the-data analysis, and an extensive set of Web
  APIs that the users will be able to use to remotely examine the LSST data set
  using tools they're already familiar with.  This document lays out the high-
  level vision for the aforementioned Aspects and some associated backend
  services. It is intentionally brief, and meant to generally guide the flow-
  down of requirements and development of product specifications,
  prioritization, and plans for the Agile development of the relevant elements
  of the DM system.
