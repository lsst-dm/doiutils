abstract: |-
  Gaussian-Aperture and PSF photometry algorithm measures consistent colors for
  extended sources such as galaxies that are largely independent of seeing. This
  technote briefly presents the mathematical description of the algorithm and
  focuses on its implementation in the Rubin Science Pipelines. This document
  also serves as a reference for several of the analytical calculations that are
  tested in the unit tests.
