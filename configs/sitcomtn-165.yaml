  Low surface brightness photometry of massive galaxies can probe the extended
  stellar halos and intracluster light but is often limited by background
  subtraction and masking systematics. Here we present radial surface brightness
  profiles for the brightest cluster galaxy of Abell 360 and 2dFGRS TGS323Z113
  using Rubin Observatory Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam) Data Preview 1 in
  the g, r, and z bands. Our results show that the LSSTComCam data can go down
  to ~28 mag arcsec^-2 in the r band.  Comparison to DECaLS measurements processed
  with Legacyhalos shows good agreement of surface brightness profiles at small
  radii while the LSSTComCam data extend deeper at larger radii.
