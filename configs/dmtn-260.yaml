abstract: |-
  The Prompt Processing system will be responsible for processing roughly a
  thousand visits per night, and distributing the results in near real time, for
  at least ten years of Rubin Observatory operations. As such, it must be highly
  robust to algorithmic, network, and infrastructure failures, ranging from
  momentary glitches to extended downtimes. DMTN-219 introduced the initial
  design for the Prompt Processing framework; this document expands on the
  design to address expected failure modes and recovery strategies for each.
