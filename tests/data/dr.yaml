abstract: |
  The Legacy Survey of Space and Time Data Preview 1 (DP1) is the first release
  of data from the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. It consists of raw and
  calibrated single-epoch images, co-adds, difference images, detection
  catalogs, and other derived data products. DP1 is based on 1792 science-grade
  optical/near-infrared exposures acquired over 48 distinct nights by the
  Rubin Commissioning Camera, LSSTComCam, on the Simonyi Survey Telescope at
  the Summit Facility on Cerro Pach√≥n, Chile during the first on-sky
  commissioning campaign in late 2024. DP1 covers a total of approximately 15
  sq. deg. over seven roughly equally-sized non-contiguous fields, each
  independently observed in six broad photometric bands, ugrizy, spanning a
  range of stellar densities and latitudes and overlapping with external
  reference datasets.
